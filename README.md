Hi, This is a GUI based application through which you can download any youtube video in their best quality for free by just providing the video link to this application. It is developed using Python in which just one extra library we are using to download the video that is pytube and we are using tkinter default library of python for gui development of this application. To convert it into a executable file we can use the PyInstaller library.



Installation

pip install pytube To make executable file of this project pip install pyinstaller Alternative of pytube Install youtube_dl pip install youtube_dl



Issue

if using pytube video is not able to download then check the 2nd script using youtube_dl library you will ba able to download your video.



You can Contribute to this application to make it good looking
